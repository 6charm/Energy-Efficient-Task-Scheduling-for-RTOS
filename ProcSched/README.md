# CC-EDF-Simulation
This is an implementation of the cycle-conserving EDF scheduler as described in the paper: [Real-time dynamic voltage scaling for low-power embedded operating systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/502059.502044).

## Usage
1. Ensure you are running Linux (I use Linux 6.1 running on a debian VM).
2. Use ```bash run.txt``` to start the simulation.
