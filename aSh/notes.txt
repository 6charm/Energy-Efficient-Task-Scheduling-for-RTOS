Issue: When there's a ; or & indicator, the parser creates a new conditional by default, 
anticipating subsequent commands. Program seg faults if there is no subsequent command
during unparse, as we have an incomplete new conditional without any command.
Goal: When a ; or & is read, create a new conditional only if there is a subsequent command token.
-> If its the last token, do not create a new conditional. (Can check via iterator?): if (!(next(it) == parser.end())) // doesnt work
-> Delete extra structs at the end of string iteration, reset next_in_list (This works).
